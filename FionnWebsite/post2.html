     <h3>Photography Assignment</h3>
		<div class="img-container">
		</div>  
        

		<p>The goal of this assignment was to capture photographs and edit them after using the photoshop software.
		We had to demostrate the use of the composition rules that we earned in class and edit the photos in photoshop to imporve the image. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I firtly decided what photographs I wanted to capture. most of the chosen photographs were static, so by using various composition rules capturing them was managable. One photo which was a little harder to take was of my dog as he very rarely stays still.
		<br>
		<br>
		What I Learned: I learned about the importance of composition rules in terms of photography and what important part they have to play in capturing photographs. I learned that photoshop can be a tedious software espically when using it for the first time, so I would recommended following tutoril to familiar yourself with the layout before diving into it.

		<h5>My Photos:</h5>
	
		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/Mackenzie1.jpg">
		</div>     
          
        <p>
		This is my dog which was probably the most difficult photo to take. I darkened the background in this picture to make the dog look fierce.
        </p>
        
        <div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/blacklight.jpg">
		</div>     
          
        <p>
	   This second image was taken nearby my house i found it peaceful. I darkened the grass in post editing, and added an effect to the water to make it stand out further.
        </p>
        <div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/Car.jpg">
		</div>     
          
        <p>
 	  This photo is a picture of my car. I wanted to do a close up to make it stand out. I seen this type of picture on a car comerical and I thought it looked really nice.
        </p>
             <div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/Football%20Boots.jpg">
		</div>      
        <p>
 	  And finally I did a simple black and white picture of my football boots. I felt like I had to include atleast one black and white picture in my project.
        </p>
