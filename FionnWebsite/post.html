		<h3>Virtual reality  whilst studying abroad</h3>

		<p>In my third year of college I was lucky to have the oppourtunity to study abroad in Denamrk.
        <br>    
		<br>
		For our group work we were working with a real life client. We had to create an immersive experience using virtual reality. The company we worked with owned an old castle which was now a museum. They mainly received an older audience and wanted attract a younger audience by adding a new technology to the castle.  this where we came into the mix of things. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Our goal was to to create this new immersive experience. We had a steep learning curve as we first needed to learn how to record 360 film by using samsung gear. We also had to learn all about the software premier pro in relation to 360 video. We had the appropioate training with both the filming and Premier pro and had a blast creating this immersive experience.
		<br>
		<br>
		What we Learned: Filming in Virtual reality can be tricky as the video is 360 degree i.e the camera can see the whole room. Therefore you cannot be in the room whilst recording. You should take long takes as it can sometimes be easier to edit afterwards. And always prepare for things to go wrong.

		Check out the video above on our idea!</p>

		<h5>The interactive video</h5>

        <p>
		This is the actual interactive video that we created. Yhe video is interactive and can be move around with your mouse by clicking and dragging! You wont quite get the full effect on being in the immersive headset. It is still nice to be able to look around the whole room!
