		<h3>Sound Design</h3>
		<p>   
		
        for this project the goal was to create a radio advert using the free platform software called Audacity. We had to create the advert using our own voice over.
		<br>
		<br>
		i firstly started by writing my voice over script. I then recorded it using the audacity software. I found using the audacity platform straight yielded the best results for the voiceover. I then applied some techniques to the voice and overall clip to achieve a radio advert.
		<br>
		<br>
		After getting my voice over satisfactory in length, I then wanted to make my voice deeper i did this by increasing the length of the clip slightly. I then followed a tutorial to furthermore achieve a radio advert sound. I then added sound effects and other techniques to finish the project off. (See below for a layout) 
		<br>
		<br>
		What i Learned: I found it useful to always save your clips when you make sufficent progress. I feel like if something goes wrong It can be hard to simply undo the work sometimes.</p>

		<h5>Audacity layout and workflow</h5>

		This is the what audacity looks like when you open it for the first time. I feel like it's not as scary as when you open something like Photoshop or premier pro for the first time
        </p>

		Here it how audacity looks when you open your sound files, or when you record in the app. the first 2 sounds as you can see are the same sounds, one is for each ear. 
        </p>

        <p>
		Here is how the instrumental music in the background looks like. I used an effect that we learned in class to reduce the level of the music. This was helpful as the background music didn't overpower the voiceover  
        </p>

		Here you can see what the indivual sound effects looks like. They are placed as specific areas, so that they play at the correct time  
        </p>

		<h5>Thanks for looking!</h5>
